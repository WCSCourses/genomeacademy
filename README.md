# Genome Academy

Welcome to the Genome Academy, a three day programme that will provide an in-depth look into genomics, with a  particular focus on how we translate DNA into Data.  

Genomics is a rapidly developing field of research and is increasingly weaving its way into everyday life, from playing a role in vaccine development, virus tracking, personalised cancer treatments, unveiling family histories, solving crime, and tackling the planet’s fragile ecosystems. There are a wide range of career opportunities in this field, some that didn’t even exist several years ago. 

Across three immersive days you will learn and experience the end to end process of how we translate DNA into data. The packed programme of activities will include talks on the latest cutting-edge science taking place at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, lab tours, hands-on experience with wet lab techniques such as DNA Extraction, PCR, DNA Sequencing as well as training with bioinformatics tools. You will also get the opportunity to meet a range of different staff working in this field.
