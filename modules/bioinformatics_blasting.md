# Welcome to Bioinformatics - Part 1 
## Introduction to linux and BLAST

This practical will guide you through working with genetics in a computer. It may not be clear just yet why you would need a computer to work in advanced biology, but by the end of this practical, this will be much clearer.

We are following after our laboratory experiments in:

- Extracting DNA from cells (plant or animal)
- Making copies of a specific sequence of DNA (PCR)
- Sequencing (reading the code) of the DNA we copied

For the sake of this practical, our bioinformaticians have saved us some time by processing the raw outputs of the sequencing machine so that we are getting complete sequences of good quality. 

## Technical Twisters! 

One of our staff is a practical joker, and has mixed up the file names of your outputs from the experiment! 

We have two files to process today, a plant gene, and an animal gene, but they are all mixed up! 

- Gene File A
- Gene File B

As well as being mixed up, they are also lost in with a bunch of random sequences!

**Your Tasks**

1.) Get Gene A and Gene B out of the mixed up file manually. 
2.) Get Gene A and Gene B out of the mixed up file with commands! 
3.) Learn which Gene is an animal which is a plant gene
4.) Make an alignment of Gene A and B for fun
