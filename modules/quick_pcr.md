# Running a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) experiment

Session 1: Running a quick PCR
In this session we will use the EDVOTEK Quick PCR kit to amplify Lamda DNA

Label a new tube as DNA mix followed by your initials 

Add your 1 PCR bead to this tube

Add 20ul of diluted primer mix 

Add 5ul of Lambda DNA mix (your DNA template)

Mix well with a pipette and securely cap the tube

The solution should turn to an orange liquid, indicating that all reagents are present and mixed.

Spin tube
Hand tube to instructor who will load the samples into the Thermocycler







Session 2: Gel Electrophoresis using Lonza Flashgel
In this process we will dye your DNA using a stain and use an electric current to pull the DNA across a special gel.  

Label a 1.5 ml tube with your sample ID.


Set a 10 µl pipette to 3 µl.


Add 3 µl the blue lonza flash gel loading dye to the tube.


Set a 10 µl pipette to 2 µl.


Add 2 µl of your PCR product into the tube.


Using your pipette gently suck the liquids up and down in the tube to mix the loading dye and PCR sample together.


Set a 10µl pipette to 5 µl.


Load 5 µl of the mixture into a well of the gel. 
The trainer will show you where to load the sample.  Be careful not to puncture the gel, or the sample won’t remain in the well
The trainer will turn on the power unit of the gel system.


Check the screen or gel. In a few minutes you will see bands appear on the gel.
If a band appears on the gel, this means there is DNA present.  If a band does not appear, The PCR reaction was not successful.  This could mean that DNA was not present in the sample or that the reaction failed.
