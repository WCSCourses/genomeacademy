# Session 1: Running a quick PCR

In this session we will use the EDVOTEK Quick PCR kit to amplify Lambda DNA

1. Label a new tube as DNA mix followed by your initials

2. Add your 1 PCR bead to this tube

3. Add 20ul of **diluted primer mix**

4. Add 5ul of **Lambda DNA mix** (your DNA template)

5. Mix well with a pipette adn securely cap the tube

6. The solution should turn to an orange liquid, indicating that all the reagents are presnet and mixed.

7. Spin tube

8. hand tube to instructor who will load the samples into the Thermocycler

## Programme for hte thermocycler:

1. Denaturation at 94<sup>o</sup>C for 3 minutes
2. 94<sup>o</sup>C cycle for 30 seconds
3. 71<sup>o</sup>C cycle for 30 seconds

Go to setp 2 for an additional 19 cycles (repeats)


# Session 2: Gel Electrophoresis using Lonza Flashgel

In this process we will dye your DNA using a stain an duse an electric current to pull the DNA across a special gel.

1. Label a 1.5ml tube with your sample ID.

2. Set a 10ul pipette to 3ul.

3. **Add 3ul of the blue Lonza flash gell loading dye** to the tube.

4. Set a 10ul pipette to 2ul.

5. **Add 2ul of your PCR product** into the tube.

6. Using your pipette gently suck the liquids up and down in the tube to mix the loading dye and PCR sample together.

7. Set a 10ul pipette to 5ul.

8. **Load 5ul of the mixture** into a well of the gel.

_The trainer will show you weher to load the sample. Be careful not to puncture the gel, or the sample won't remain in the well._

9. The trainer will turn on the power unit of the gel system.

10. Check the screen or gel. In a few minutes you will see bands appear on the gel.

_If a band appears on the gel, this means theere is DNA present. If a band does not appear, the PCR reaction was not successful. This could mean theat DNA was not present in the sample or that the reaction failed._
